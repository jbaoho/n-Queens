n-Queens Program

The purpose of this program is to give a solution to the famous n-Queens and determine how many solutions
there are for any board of size n x n. The program will have difficulty running for any n x n boards above an n of 20.
The algorithm looks through a tree of 2^n possibilities for potential solutions and uses back-tracking and pruning
to cut down time by not searching for solutions of boards already known to fail.

The nQueens.java program uses the Java Arrays and Scanner libraries.
